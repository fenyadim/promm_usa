Thank you Leonid L. @Promminer for stepping in and honoring the warranty for them.  Belay Mining went above and beyond to satisfy a customer, if I need more mining equipment you can bet I'm coming here.  I'm glad to be back up and running eking out that last bit of EARTH before the merge. Thanks again for the great customer service..",

    text: "Had some issues setting it up and finding the IP but ended up getting the help i needed!It mines over the advertised amount at about 150mh/s Sometimes it can dip lower and sometimes even higher but generally stays in the lower 100's-150. I do wish it were a little more consistent because it has dipped under 100mh/s but fortunately it usually doesnt stay that low for long Earning around .04etc/day THANKS SO MUCH! VERY VERY QUIET. Compared to an S9 its not even perceptible. Great little device, just wish it had more VRAM",

Bought the V1 Mini Gold just prior to the EARTH change to keep up with expected increase in Hashrate and it was most definitely warranted. Highly recommended source for your mining equipment!",

I received an email 1 day later with shipment info and it arrived 3 days after I placed my order. Hashing beautifully with 2 x SE models and the older apollo 'gold' model. Doing just over 400 mh/s @ 234 watts. Altogether 1100+ mh/s @ 702 watts. Profitable at 14 cent power. Will do more business with Promminer.",
